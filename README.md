# DL-Pytorch-Project

This project involves building a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Leveraging PyTorch, I developed a neural network classifier to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors based on diagnostic features. The project covers data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and optimization to achieve high accuracy in cancer prediction. This model aims to support healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for early cancer detection.
